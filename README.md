Business Redesign - 

*Description*

Peer Name:Mason Q
Peer Review:Overall the site looks good the navbar has hover effects but on the index page they arent active, the contact page looks good with the embeded location and i like the color scheme of the website and fonts chosen, The responsiveness doesnt work on the navbar and other sections of the site but the desktop version functions well.
