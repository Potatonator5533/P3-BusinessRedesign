**Description**: We redesigned a website for a business we thought needed a glow up and built it off a prototype we have created.

### Peer Review

**Reviewer**: Mason Q

**Reviewer Notes**: Overall the site looks good the navbar has hover effects but on the index page they arent active, the contact page looks good with the embeded location and i like the color scheme of the website and fonts chosen, The responsiveness doesnt work on the navbar and other sections of the site but the desktop version functions well.
